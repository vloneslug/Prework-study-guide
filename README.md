## Description
Web Starter is a beginner friendly framework and series of sub-systems that helps you understand a beginner friendly web-development topic at random. Feeling like a newborn web developer can be daunting at times. A great thing about newborns is the fact that they will grow. Whats even better is that newborns grow quite fast! Every developer must start somwhere and having some guidance along the way is unarguably benifitial. 
I decided to create this application for indivudials who are freshly discovering web development and need help selecting a foundational language/tool. Knowing where to start a new journey can be dificult. Web development is full of many languages and tools can be used; with my application a tool/language is selected for you and you're guided though the basics of what and how a tool is used.
